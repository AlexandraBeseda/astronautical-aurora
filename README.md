## Developer Notes

About the tech stack ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt know most of the tools before,
but setting everything up turned out to be fast and easy.
I managed to install all the dependencies and configure the project quickly.
Good documentation, YouTube tutorials, and ChatGPT with the right prompts helped a lot.

The most difficult part was functionality updating an existing task.
I used to work with React, so at first, I wanted to use client-side navigation like in React.
But this project uses server-side rendering (SSR), so I had to change how I think about page updates.
After watching a few examples on YouTube, I understood how to do it, and it became much easier.

For the UI, Tailwind CSS was also quite easy to use.
With a few ChatGPT tips, I could build the layout without problems.

Overall, this was a very interesting task.
I had never used Tailwind CSS, Svelte, Astro, SQLite, or Prisma before, but everything was simpler than I expected.

The OpenAI integration was quick because I had some experience with it before.
The only issue now is that I don‚Äôt have a paid OpenAI key.
If you also don‚Äôt have one, I‚Äôve added a commented-out fallback in the code.
